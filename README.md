## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Group 9's project is about analyzing the world happiness report. The topic of world happiness wasn't that interesting to us as the topic of our analysis. However, as each of member were from different countries with different background we got curious if this data set could tell a lot more than what we can see at a glance. That's why we decided to trying to figure out the underline basis of "happiness" as this was an interesting concept that we wanted to explore. By analyzing and understanding the data set, we hope to gain knowledge as to which factors impact happiness the most, or if there was a reason certain region was more "happy" than others, and many more. Thus while the data set wasn't that interesting to us, what we could learn from the analysis was. That is why we, the members of group 9, have chosen to analyze the World Happiness Data set.
